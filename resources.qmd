<p class="custom-subtitle">Here is my custom subtitle.</p>

<p>And here is some normal text beneath it.</p>

[Here is another custom subtitle written with Quarto syntax]{.custom-subtitle}

Also note that I do not need to wrap this text in the `<p>` tag in order for it to render as normal text. `.qmd` files allow us to seamlessly blend markdown syntax with HTML.
